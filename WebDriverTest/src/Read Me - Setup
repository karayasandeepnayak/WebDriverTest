Pre-requisite
1) Install the latest version of Eclipse and Google Chrome browser
2) Download and install Java 8.

Setup:
1) Download and install Selenium Server - (version 3.13.0) 
   You can download this from the website ->https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/
   Click the link (3.13.0) under 'Selenium Standalone Server' section.
   Add all the jar files to the classpath of the eclipse project
   
2) Download and install Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings
   Go to https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/ webpage
   Under, 'Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings', click on Java download
   A zip file will be downloaded. Extract the zip file and add all the jars present
   in this zip file to the project's class path in eclipse.
   
3) Download and install Chrome Driver
   Go to https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/ webpage.
   Scroll down to - 'Third Party Browser Drivers NOT DEVELOPED by seleniumhq' section
   Select Google Chrome Driver, and download the latest version (2.41) correponding
   to your machine (example chromedriver_win32.zip for windows)
   Extract the zip file. You should find chromedriver.exe

Please Note:   
To run my java test files, create a folder named RobotFramework in C: drive.
This folder is where the extracted chromedriver.exe needs to be placed. Alternatively,
you can keep the chromedriver.exe file in any folder you wish and change the System 
property in each Java code to point to the correct folder with the chromedriver exe.

Once you have imported my project/java files from github into your eclipse IDE, 
you will have to run each Java class file individually to run the test cases.
